  <p> To play this you have to enter all the tasks you have to do everyday and next to that type if you want to do it now or later. If you type do it later for all of them you will have many tasks pending. Once you finish a task you click on it and it will cross of. Every day you can add more tasks. After every three tasks you will be able to have a break.Every Break time gives you 10 points. The more tasks, the more breaks, the more breaks, the more points. Next to every break you add you should add the number of points. Ex; Break 1 - 10 points, Break 2 - 20 points... and so on so forth. If you have a break before three tasks you have to type -10 points. It will deduct 10 points from what you have or if you have no points and the first task is a break then you get no points. Each day you can get max 6 breaks, no more no less.
